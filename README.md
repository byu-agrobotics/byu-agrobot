**Getting Started:**

- Install WSL2 on your Windows machine by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

- Install Docker Desktop on your Windows machine by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), and enable the WSL 2 backend by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).

- Open a WSL terminal and clone this repository into your Linux environment using `git clone https://github.com/BYUAgrobotics/AgRobot.git`.

- Navigate into the AgRobot repository and run `bash setup.sh` to pull our sub-level repositories and set up the coding environment.

- Run `bash compose.sh` to pull and launch the latest Docker image from DockerHub.

  > **NOTE:** If you ever need to restart the container, simply run `bash compose.sh down` to stop the container, and then `bash compose.sh` to start it again.

**Contributing:**

- **Create a new branch.** Our main code branches are protected, so you'll need to create a new branch. Name your branch with a combination of your name and the feature you are working on (i.e. nelson/repo-docs).

- **Make your changes.** Develop and debug your new feature or bug fix.

  > **NOTE:** If you need to add dependencies, add them to the Dockerfile in your branch and test building the image locally. Once your pull request is merged into main, GitHub CI will automatically build and push the new Docker image to DockerHub.

- **Rebase your branch often.** Keep your branch up-to-date with main by rebasing. This will help prevent merge conflicts down the road.

- **Submit a pull request.** Once you have made and tested your changes, create a new pull request. Get another member of the team to review and approve it, and you can merge your new code into the main branch.
